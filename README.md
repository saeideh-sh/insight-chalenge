In this challenge I implemented calculating the median of the connectivity of the users in Venmo Payments. The code requires the following dependencies:

from datetime import datetime
import dateutil.parser
import json # This package is called for JSON file formatting
import numpy as np # This package is called for Numerical analyses
import statistics as st # This package is called for Statistical Analyses
import networkx as nx # This package is called for Graph analysis
